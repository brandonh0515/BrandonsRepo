1. Make sure httpd service is installed 
    yum install -y httpd
2. Place your document root in the configuration file or confirm it is there
    vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
3. touch /var/www/html/index.html
4. Put text in the /var/www/html/index.hmtl which would be what shows up on the apache web server
    echo "hello world" > /var/www/html/index.html
5. Add port 80 via firewall rules or ec2 security groups, so httpd can communicate
6. chown apache:apache /var/www/html/index.html
7. start httpd and enable it 
     systemctl start httpd
     systemctl enable httpd 

The Apache Web Server should be up and running after that.
